# Ministry.TestSupport #
The aim of the Ministry Test Support Libraries is to provide a suite of Fakes, Mocks and assertion classes that make the process of testing easier. This is not exclusively for unit testing either, the libraries also support console automation testing.

The details for using this are covered in the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/ministryotech/testsupport/wiki)
